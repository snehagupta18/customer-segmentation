## Customer Segmentation Project

### Project Goal
This project aims to develop a customer segmentation model using the K-means clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer purchasing behavior and demographic data, the model identifies distinct customer groups to inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Methodology
A K-means clustering algorithm was employed to segment customers based on their annual income and spending scores. The model successfully identified five distinct customer clusters.

### Customer Clusters
* **Cluster 1 (Green):** Moderate income, moderate spending.
* **Cluster 2 (Red):** High income, high spending (high-value customers).
* **Cluster 3 (Yellow):** High income, low spending (potential growth segment).
* **Cluster 4 (Violet):** Low income, low spending.
* **Cluster 5 (Blue):** Low income, high spending.

### Marketing Insights and Recommendations
* **High-Value Customers (Cluster 2):** Implement personalized marketing and loyalty programs to retain and further engage this valuable customer segment.
* **Growth Opportunities (Cluster 5 & 1):** Target moderate-income, high-spending customers with promotions and product offerings to drive revenue growth.
* **Potential Customers (Cluster 3):** Develop tailored marketing strategies to encourage increased spending and loyalty among high-income, low-spending customers.
* **Segment Customization:** Tailor marketing, products, and services based on the unique characteristics of each customer segment for maximum impact.

By leveraging these insights, businesses can optimize marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and drive overall business growth.
